WP-Instaroll - TODOs:
============

- add, in settings, the possibility of choosing the **category** to associate Instagram-based automatically created posts
	- when setting the category, check for it's existance and create it if not present
- personalized icons for menus and panels
- possibility of choosing between using the pic as post featured image (as now is) or insert it in post content


to be done later:
-----------
- error message when a post can be created but not the image (uploads dir not writeable, etc...)
- better confirmation dialogbox for post creation
- category to be used for posts:
	- show list of available categories (only one is selectable)
	- input box with add button, for creating a new category
- give the possibility of using multiple seach tags (comma separated)
- multilanguage
