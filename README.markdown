Description
-----------

Simple Instagram plug-in for creating WordPress posts from Instagram photos (both from user stream and by using a specific search tag).

You can browse photos in your user stream, or by the specified tag, import them into WordPress media library and link it to post, with the possibility of choosing between adding it as featured image (post thumbnail) or directly inside the post (default).

The posts created from Instagram photos can be saved as draft or directly published.

The plug-in keeps track of previously published photos and avoids downloading them from Instagram again, if they're already present in local media library, in case a single photo is used for creating multiple posts.

In photos selection panels there's a checkbox for specifying whether to show already published Instagram photos (default) or not.
